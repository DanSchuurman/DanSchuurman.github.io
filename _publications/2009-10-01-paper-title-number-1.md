Climate change continues to fuel concern about the future cost of publicly-subsidized
crop insurance programs in developed nations. These climate changes are expected to
alter the upper and lower tails of crop yield distributions differently. This may best be
captured by modeling the climate-yield relationship heterogeneously across different
parts of the yield distribution. To this end, we consider a mixture model with the com-
ponent probabilities expressed as nonparametric functions (to capture non-linearities)
of weather variables estimated by machine learning methods (neural net). By doing
so, we are able to identify possibly heterogeneous effects of climate change on each
component, the mixing probabilities, and thus all moments of the yield distribution.
We find changing climate alters, quite significantly, the entire shape of the yield dis-
tribution. The overall mass of the lower tail tends to increase as temperatures rise, to
the point where some yield distributions even become positively skewed. Under the
most probable climate scenario (RCP 4.5), the effect of climate on expected losses is
small; positive in the short term and negative in the long-term. Importantly, we find
differing rates of technological change to consistently raise insurance costs with quicker
rates of temperature, relative to the rate of technological change, ameliorating this
effect. Overall, the resulting insurance costs from climate are considerably less drastic
than previous work due to heterogeneous effects across the yield distribution raising
the probability of lower component yields and slowing the rate of technology
